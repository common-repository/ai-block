== How it Works ==

AI Block uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API to generate text. The API is a powerful tool that uses advanced AI technology to generate text based on a prompt.

The block provides a simple text field where you can enter your prompt. Once you've entered your prompt, you can click the "Send" button to submit your request to the API. The API will then generate your content and return it to the block.

Generated content is added to the page, above the AI block as multiple paragraph blocks contained in a single Group block. This makes it easy to edit or delete all of the generated blocks in one go.
